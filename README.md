# ChessRunner
Chess-style infinite runner game

C++ infinite runner chess game using SDL. You can only make moves that take a piece, but taking a piece means you turn into that piece, and gain its moves! You have to plan ahead to avoid dead ends, but watch out! The board is infinitely moving, and if you fall off, it's game over!

I did this as a custom project for Swinburne's Games Programming unit, so most of the work is already done in a private bitbucket repository that I can't share because it's mostly answers to course work.
